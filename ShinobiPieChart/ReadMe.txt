Known Issues:
-------------

1. On orientation change, in the landscape mode, the button and the text views are not visible as scrollbars have not been added in the layout xml.
2. Couldnot figure out how to calculate engagement and active users. Hence, harcoded the value.


TODO improvements:
-------------------
1. Busy icon on loading the list view
2. Fixing the orientation issue
3. Adding logs in the source code
4. Declaring all the strings in string.xml rather than in the .java files.
5. Beautification of UI.
